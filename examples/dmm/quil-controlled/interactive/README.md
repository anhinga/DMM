this is a subdirectory for interactive experiments, with the intention to implement along these lines:

Jan 24, 2018 - it is a variant of Jul 13, 2017 experiment which, in addition, allows to
imitate a mouse click by typing something like `(mp 120 50)` in the graphics window;
so this does not edit the network yet, but just exercises the interaction pipeline.

Jan 25, 2018 - in progress (so far, Jan 24 code was refactored a bit, and backspace capability added)
