# Notes for examples of DMMs

**Dataflow matrix machines** are a generalization of recurrent neural networks.

Oct 19, 2016 experiment implements the scheme presented in the
Appendix D.2.2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00831

Oct 28, 2016 experiment implements a non-blocking asynchronous
input to a running DMM (inspired by various examples, including
in particular the program fragment described in
Section 3.1 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09470).

Nov 4, 2016 experiment in progress...
