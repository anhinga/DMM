# T-shirt images

Here we keep images we are using to print *dark t-shirts* on Zazzle.

These images tend to be **white on transparent background**
(which is the format needed to print t-shirts without excessive paint
and is particularly important for making
reasonable quality dark t-shirts).

It might be difficult to see such images in common image viewers
which tend to represent transparent background as white,
but professional image editing systems such as
GNU Image Manipulation Program

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP

show them reasonably well.
