# T-shirt images

Here we keep images we are using to print *dark t-shirts* on Zazzle.

These images tend to be **white on transparent background**.

The transparent background is needed to print t-shirts without excessive paint,
and white on transparent background is how one makes white images
on dark t-shirts.

It might be difficult to see such images in common image viewers
which tend to represent transparent background as white,
but professional image editing systems such as
GNU Image Manipulation Program

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP

show them reasonably well. GitHub actually shows those
images not too bad (it uses a checkered pattern to depict
transparent background), but a professional system shows
them better.
